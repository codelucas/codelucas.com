  <h1>Hi, it's nice to meet you!</h1>
  <p class="lead">
     My full name is <b class="black">Lucas Lee Ou-Yang</b>. 
     I am 20 years old and I was born in Dallas, Texas in 1993. 
  </p>
</div>
  <div class="left">
    <p><em>My parents decided to name me after 
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_IV:_A_New_Hope">Luke Skywalker</a>, 
    as they were Star Wars fans!</em> </p>

    <p>
    I've lived in Dallas, Chicago, Austin, Seattle, and Orange County.
    I run, snowboard, code, and read in my spare time.  </p>

    <p>In the Fall of '11, I started university at <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/">UCI</a> in California, 
    where I learned how to write code. Learning how to program has changed my life. </p>
    
    <p>In the Winter of '12, I wrote my first game, <a href="http://codelucas.com/pages/rocketboy.html">
        RocketBoy!</a>, a 2-D platformer.</p>

    <p>In the Summer of '12, I wrote a much more complicated game where I hand drew all the
    graphics, <a href="http://codelucas.com/pages/island-overlord.html">IslandOverlord</a>, 
    inspired by one of <a href="https://mojang.com/notch/">Notch's</a> early games.</p>

    <p>In the Fall of '12 I wrote <a href="https://github.com/codelucas/darehut.com">Darehut</a>, a website 
    where teenagers can dare eachother to do things. Darehut was built with 
    A lot of <a href="http://reddit.com">Reddit's</a> internal code and mechanics.</p>
    
    <p>In the Winter of '12, I interned at <a href="http://www.m2catalyst.com/">M2Catalyst</a>, where I 
    learned how to build android modules.</p>

    <p>In the Summer of '13, I started a news entertainment company, <a href="http://wintria.com">Wintria</a> 
    with my friend <a href="http://www.nithinjilla.com/">Nithin Jilla</a>. We hit 4K unique visitors on 
    our first day of release and became investor backed. I wrote all of the backend and frontend 
    code for Wintria.</p>

    <p>In the Fall of '13 I attended <a href="http://pennapps.com">Pennapps</a>, the biggest college 
    hackathon in America and built <a href="http://socialrank.codelucas.com">SocialRank</a>. 
    SocialRank is a news aggregator using 
    <a href="http://amix.dk/blog/post/19588">Reddit's hotness algorithm</a> but using Facebook 
    likes instead of upvotes!</p>

    <p>Over the hollidays of '13, I wrote <a href="https://github.com/codelucas/newspaper">Newspaper</a>.
    Newspaper is a python library which abstracts online news extraction and curation. <strong>It is my
    most succesful piece of software to date and has been downloaded by employees of The NYT, The LA times,
    Flipboard, CNN, and many more</strong>. Newspaper reigned the #3 trending library of Janurary '14 on Github
    and it has been starred over 1K times.
    </p> 

    <p>In the Winter of '14 I wrote a minimal & extendable Reddit clone: 
      <a href="http://reddit.codelucas.com">Flask_Reddit</a> which many beginners
      found useful.
    </p>

    <p>Near the end of Winter, I finished prototyping and released 
      <a href="http://shorten.tv">www.shorten.tv</a>, the world's first video summarization
      tool. This tool was written with ffmpeg, python, and the google api.
    </p>

    <p>I am currently working on creating and organizing <a href="http://hackuci.com">HackUCI</a> 
    with many other awesome people from UCI and around the country!

    I am also working on <a href="http://antchatter.com">Antchatter</a>. 
    Antchatter is a chatroom for university students... but with a twist!
    </p>

    <p>I will be interning at <a href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</a> in the Summer of '14.
    </p>

    <p>I hope to graduate in the Fall of '14 with a degree in Computer Science. I have no 
    intentions for grad school. I want to write open source code and work for an impactful 
    company or group of people.</p>

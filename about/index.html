    <h1>Hi, it's nice to meet you!</h1>
    <p class="lead">
       My full name is <b class="black">Lucas Lee Ou-Yang</b>. 
       <br>
       I am 21 years old and I was born in Dallas, Texas in 1993. 
       <br>

    <p><em>My parents named me after 
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_IV:_A_New_Hope">Luke Skywalker</a>, 
    as they were Star Wars fans!</em> </p>

    <p>I pretty much had no idea where I was going in life all throughout childhood and highschool.
    I went to a college in Southern California called <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/">UCI</a> for
    Computer Science. Software stood out because it let me express my creativity with a
    low barrier to entry.</p>
    
    <p>In the Summer of '13, I started a news entertainment company, <a href="http://wintria.com">
    Wintria</a> with my friend <a href="http://www.nithinjilla.com/">Nithin Jilla</a>. 
    We hit 4K unique visitors on our first day of release and became investor backed. 
    I wrote all of the backend and frontend code for Wintria.</p>

    <p>Over the hollidays of '13, I wrote <a href="https://github.com/codelucas/newspaper">Newspaper</a>.
    Newspaper is a library which abstracts online news extraction. It is my
    most succesful piece of software and has been downloaded by employees of The NYT, 
    The LA times, Flipboard, CNN, and many more. Newspaper sat at the #3 trending 
    library spot of Janurary '14 on Github.</p> 

    <p>During Spring '14 I helped create and organize <a href="http://hackuci.com">HackUCI</a> 
    with many other awesome people from UCI and around the country!</p>

    <p>I interned at <a href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</a> over the Summer of '14 and
    it was a lot of fun! I enjoyed the
    <a href="http://medium.com/@lucasou/my-summer-in-the-bay-84b29bd08bbc">experience</a>
    there so much that I returned fulltime as a software engineer.</p>

    <p>I live in the San Francisco Bay and love meeting new people to have fun with and
    also to talk technology and business with. Interested? Hit me up!</p>

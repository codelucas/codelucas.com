    <h1>Hi, it's nice to meet you!</h1>
    <p class="lead">
       My full name is <b class="black">Lucas Lee Ou-Yang</b>. 
       <br>
       I am 23 years old and I was born in Dallas, Texas.

    <p><em>My parents named me after 
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_IV:_A_New_Hope">Luke Skywalker</a>, 
    as they were Star Wars fans!</em> </p>

    <p>I'm based out of the Greater Los Angeles Area and I work for Snapchat in Venice Beach.</p>

    <p>In my spare time, I enjoy playing guitar, going out for Korean BBQ, distance running,
    watching Netflix, snowboarding, drinking, making coffee and going out for coffee/boba. I really like
    John Mayer for his bluesy guitar sound and dramatic lyrics. JM's
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aN-BpX_VRI">songs</a> are difficult but I'm slowly mastering
    them! I've also been getting into kpop, check out this 
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMtCJC39SqU">great song</a> by Jay Park!</p>

    <p>Before Snapchat, I was based out of the San Francisco Bay Area and worked on user engagement for
    Instagram & Facebook. <a href="https://goo.gl/HtrKCD">It was a lot of fun</a>! Over my 2 years there,
    I largely boosted user engagement most of the app: search, explore, and parts of profile and feed.
    Check out my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/nhome/updates?activity=6210139457329463296">goodbye post</a>.
    </p>

    <p>Before that, I went to <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/">UCI</a>, a college in Southern California,
    for Computer Science. It was a great experience! During school, I started a news entertainment company, 
    <a href="http://wintria.com">Wintria</a>, with my friend <a href="http://www.nithinjilla.com/">Nithin Jilla</a>. 
    We hit 4,000 unique visitors on our first day of release and became investor backend.</p>

    <p>Around the time when Wintria was started I also wrote
    <a href="https://github.com/codelucas/newspaper">Newspaper</a>.
    Newspaper is a library which abstracts online news extraction. It's my most succesful
    personal work and is award winning on Github, holding the #1 downloaded & forked python project for
    months. It has also been downloaded and used by the engineering teams at: The New York Times, The LA Times,
    CNN, Parse.ly, and many more.</p> 

    <p>I'm always open to socialize, give & receive advice, meet-up, collaborate, hangout, or more. Please
    don't hesitate to reach out! I'm best reached via email (<i>lucasyangpersonal@gmail.com</i>) or
    Facebook messenger.</p>
    
    <p>And yes, the car in the photo from the homepage is mine :) The photo was taken on
    a drive in Southern California's famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angeles_Crest_Highway">
    Angeles Crest Highway</a>.</p>

    <h1>Hi, it's nice to meet you!</h1>
    <p class="lead">
       My full name is <b class="black">Lucas Lee Ou-Yang</b>. 
       <br>
       I am 22 years old and I was born in Dallas, Texas.

    <p><em>My parents named me after 
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_IV:_A_New_Hope">Luke Skywalker</a>, 
    as they were Star Wars fans!</em> </p>

    <p>I'm based out of the San Francisco Bay Area and I work for Instagram. My work
    involves mostly machine learning and web infra. <a href="https://goo.gl/HtrKCD">It's a
    lot of fun</a>!</p>

    <p>In my spare time, I enjoy playing guitar, distance running, snowboarding, roadtripping,
    and meeting people. I really like John Mayer for his bluesy guitar sound and dramatic /
    romantic lyrics. JM's <a href="https://youtu.be/A6NgmkRmJhE">songs</a> are difficult but I'm
    slowly mastering them!</p>

    <p>I went to <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/">UCI</a>, a college in Southern California,
    for CS. In the Summer of '13, I started a news entertainment company, <a href="http://wintria.com">
    Wintria</a>, with my friend <a href="http://www.nithinjilla.com/">Nithin Jilla</a>. 
    We hit 4,000 unique visitors on our first day of release and became investor backend.</p>

    <p>Around the time when Wintria was started I also wrote
    <a href="https://github.com/codelucas/newspaper">Newspaper</a>.
    Newspaper is a library which abstracts online news extraction. It's my most succesful
    personal work and has been downloaded by employees of The New York Times, The LA Times, and CNN.
    </p> 

    <p>During Spring '14 I helped create and organize <a href="http://hackuci.com">HackUCI</a> 
    with many other awesome people from UCI and around the country!</p>

    <p>I interned at <a href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</a> during Summer '14. I enjoyed the
    <a href="http://medium.com/@lucasou/my-summer-in-the-bay-84b29bd08bbc">experience</a>
    there so much that I returned fulltime as a software engineer.</p>

    <p>
        This is a sandboxesque game where you have the pleasure of watching an island society, 
        from it's creation to ... well that's up to you! 
        As their unnoticed god, you have the option to watch them, cast god spells and powers on them, or
        even speed up time! It's all up to your mood and your will :)

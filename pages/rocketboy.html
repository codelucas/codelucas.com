        <li>W - Toggle jetpack on and off. (There is limited gas, but you can refil!) </li>
        <li>A - Move left </li>
        <li>S - Move right  </li>
        <li>D - Releases balloons (which in turn generates a quick downward spike in velocity!)</li>

    <p>
        Platforms have a limited "gravity" effect, so landing on them isn't difficult. 
        Platforms can have spikes or gas stations, spikes pop your balloons, gas fills your jetpack. 
        The number of balloons decides your vertical velocity, the more the faster. 
        HINT: Don't waste jetpack fuel (when you are already flying up with balloons. 
        Your handy jetpack has a missile detector, you can see the missile's 
        x-coordinate moving prior to when it appears. 
        The objective is to achieve the highest altitude (measured by points).

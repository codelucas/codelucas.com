One of my favorite quotes:

> Almost everything--all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure--these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.

Really gets the blood pumping, huh?

Interesting story about this video. Steve Jobs narrated the very first version of this Think Different commercial "Here's to the Crazy Ones" (shown above). Sadly, this version never aired. Richard Dreyfuss did the voiceover in [the version that aired](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oAB83Z1ydE).

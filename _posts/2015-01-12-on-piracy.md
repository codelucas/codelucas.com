The sole reason for the growing number of debates over internet piracy and copyright law is the *virtual* characteristic of virtual goods. That is to say, music, books, games, and other virtual goods can be copied throughout the internet at scale and without restriction. Can you imagine thousands of new SUVs springing to life from their blueprint? *Physical* goods lack this differentiating and important trait.

The debate over piracy boils down to whether or not copying virtual goods from one place to another should be considered a crime.

Advocates on one side argue that copying virtual goods isn't equal to theft. This is best illustrated with a comparison with physical goods. If I run off with my roommate's laptop, that would make him short one laptop. If I copied a PDF book from his laptop to mine, we'd have two duplicate PDF books as a whole. 

Advocates on the other side argue that copying virtual goods should count as stealing just as much as thieving physical goods does. Individuals and companies still need to work to create the goods to sell, the fact that they are virtual should not matter. If everyone were to just copy content around, how will content creators make money? 

Suppose there existed a shoe duplication machine; I walk into a Nike store and make unlimited copies of every shoe. I then give them out to anyone who asks. Nike will lose sales from this act so it counts as theft. Though this example sounds equivalent to the copying process of virtual goods, **it is not**.  Nike shoes cost money to design, produce, distribute, and advertise, whereas virtual goods only need to be designed and advertised, the production and distribution are free. 

Imagine if the shoes only had to be designed and advertised. Whenever anyone wanted a pair, they'd pay online and a new pair of shoes will spawn out of a blueprint and magically fly to the buyer. If this were the case, there would surely be an uproar with the current pricing of the shoes. $60? That's outrageous!

If shoe duplication existed, it would make sense for Nike to charge significantly less for their shoes or to change their pricing model, e.g., a fixed monthly subscription for ten shoes every month. Nike would still be able to support itself and its employees because of how much cheaper it will be to run their business.

The above scenario is analogous to how virtual goods are handled. Virtual goods require neither production nor distribution. In the case of software, the source code is the blueprint *and* the completed prototype. Also, virtual goods don't require a costly distribution; a beautiful system, the internet, has already been created for that purpose. 

We come to similar conclusions: people should pay for virtual goods but the pricing models need to change. Stop using adblock if you're being given a free product or service. If you feel that the songs are too pricy on iTunes then demand lower prices or a different payment model, e.g., *Spotify* and *Pandora*, as a collective instead of pirating the music -- and adding tension to both sides as a result.

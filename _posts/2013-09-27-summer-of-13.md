Today is the first day of school and Summer is now officially over!

My friend [Nithin](http://nithinjilla.com) and I incorporated an investor backed startup, [Wintria](http://wintria.com).  I also bought a car, almost got scammed, interned at Canon, and attended my first hackathon. 

All of it was awesome and the perfect SoCal weather made it better. But more importantly, these experiences, some good and some bad, allowed for reflection.

###Wintria - Our Startup

Working with Nithin on Wintria has been a great experience so far. The challenge that Wintria is trying to solve is intimate to me and I love it. There are millions of ways to aggregate and present news content, but to do it sensibly and elegantly to the user, then the task becomes a real challenge. **This is our goal**. Think of `Reddit's subreddit dynamic` or `Twitter's 140 character limit`. 

<u>These distinctive traits can change everything about a media platform</u>. There are serious opportunities in this field. The big software giants like Facebook and Yahoo are acquiring content aggregators and curators left and right.

Nithin, who recently graduated, has been a mentor to me over the past few months. He documents and re-analyzes everything. Our personalities and skills are unique and they complement each other greatly. As a result, we get into a lot of disagreements but we have learned a lot from each other. One of my biggest mistakes was that I had a habit of taking individual feedback for Wintria way to seriously and personal. If Nithin wasn't  there to stop me, i'd literally listen to user after user and implement their advice one by one. Sometimes the feedback from one user would even contradict the feedback from another user! I'm trying too hard to please everyone instead of looking at the bigger picture.

Above anything else, the main piece of advice which Nithin has passed down to me is that stubbornness slows progress down.

> You can't do everything by yourself, and we can't do everything by ourselves. - Nithin Jilla

Wintria's first investor and friend has also been a great mentor for the two of us. We will work our hardest on the company and the product together. Visit our facebook or twitter pages for updates.

###The Scam - Dangers of entrepreneurship

Before Summer started, an older & established man approached one of my TA's, my friend, and myself for the opportunity of forming a startup with him. *I'm not comfortable naming anyone*.

For our first 2 meetings, he impressed the hell out of us. He drove us in this huge S class Mercedes and treated us to the [nicest restaurant](http://www.montagelagunabeach.com/) in Laguna Beach with the intention of asking us to build him a `prototype`. Every girl in that restaurant was super attractive and the menu's didn't have prices on them. 

What had begun to bother me was the repetition of the phrase `we are all cofounders` and  `equal shares`. This was weird because he would only talk about the prototype and the product with us. A lot of legal, IP, funding, company issues were simply never raised. Whenever I asked something that was slightly inquisitive, he would say something about how we will all make a billion dollars. <u>This gave me an unsettling feeling</u>. 

> I created an impression for myself that this figure was a modern day conman. Everything about him began strain me: his way of dress, how he talked to us students, it all felt very manipulative.

I asked him for a timeline of our operations after the prototype, **no response**. After that, I angrily decided to back out. I later found out from the TA that both the startup and prototype both did not work out at all..

If you don't feel comfortable with a group of people, whatever the occasion, get to the bottom of why you are not feeling comfortable. Human [`fight or flight`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight-or-flight_response) instinct is powerful.

###Internship at Canon

Interning at Canon was lots of fun. We touched upon and used a lot of services, like apache SOLR, Hadoop, Hbase, etc. I don't think I can get more specific than that though because of NDA reasons!

I loved my coworkers. Sam, Quinten, Fernando, you guys are all awesome people and excellent engineers. Hari, you are a legend. I literally want to be like you when I grow up. Hari is a middle aged security engineer who drives a porshe and gives no fucks. Al prefers to stay anonymous, even on the web, so I can't say much except he has taught me a lot! Craig, you are an excellent manager! It was fun having lunch with you and working with you guys.

###Pennapps 2013 - Awesome Hacks


[Pennapps](http://pennapps.com), which is held at UPenn twice a year, is America's `largest college hackathon`. Attending it was very enlightening because it was my first [hackathon](https://www.google.com/search?q=define%3Ahackathon&oq=define) and I never really had the chance to sit down with a big group of other people who genuinely enjoyed building stuff. Some of the projects which were created required a **deep** understanding in multiple fields and disciplines, not just software. 

Compared to local or smaller school sponsored hackathons, this was on a whole new level. Contestants came from over **100 universities** all over the globe and free food and tons of sponsor gear were provided! I ended up recieving $100 in AWS credit, $2000 appengine credit, and 10GB Dropbox storage! Oh, and unlimited free tshirts :) 

Also, a lot of the companies which sponsored the event presented their services and [API's](http://2013f.pennapps.com/apis.html) for free usage to the contestants. This was amazing because I wasen't aware of the API's and many seemed very useful. I especially loved [`firebase`](https://www.firebase.com/) and [`twilio`](http://twilio.com/). All in all, a lot of cool stuff was built. Also, Pennsylvania and Philidelphia are both gorgeous. Check out my submission: [SocialRank](http://socialrank.codelucas.com)

If I could change something about my experience, I regret not going with a team. A lot of the teams there had shifts where one person would work while others slept or ate. This was much harder if you were alone, especially without any other friends there.

###Conclusion

Summer was great. My close friend from high school, Jake, came down to SoCal from Seattle to visit! I also got to visit home with my family before school started. Basketball with my brother & friends friends was fun! <u>Tommy, Jack, Bryce</u>. 

But i'm back on campus now and ready for the next year. Check out this awesome view from my new apartment.

Goodbye for now!

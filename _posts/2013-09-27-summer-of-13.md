Today is the first day of school and Summer is now officially over!

A lot has happened. My friend [Nithin](http://nithinjilla.com) and I incorporated an investor backed startup, [Wintria](http://wintria.com).  I also purchased a car, almost got scammed, interned at a big company, and attended my first hackathon. 

All of it was new and eye opening and the perfect SoCal weather made it better. But most importantly, these experiences, some good and some bad, allow for reflection.

###Wintria - Our Startup

At the start of January 2013, I had begun to write the code for what would become our news aggregator startup, [Wintria](http://wintria.com). The challenge that Wintria is trying to solve is intimate to me and I love it. There are millions of ways to aggregate and present news content, but to do it sensibly and elegantly to the user, then the task becomes a real challenge. This is reinforced by the fact that [as of 2013, nearly all news aggregators have
failed](http://www.quora.com/News-Aggregators/As-of-2013-why-have-personalized-news-startups-failed). However, there are a few underdog success stories. Think of Reddit's subreddit dynamic or Twitter's 140 character limit. These distinctive traits can change everything about a media platform.

Working with Nithin, my partner for Wintria who I met this Summer, has been both exciting and uncomfortable. Our skills and strong personalities are unique and they complement each other greatly. As a result, we get into a lot of unfortunate disagreements, but we have learned much from each other. One of my shortcomings was a habit of taking individual feedback way to personally. If Nithin weren't there to stop me, i'd literally listen to user after user and implement their
advice one by one. I don't know whether or not Wintria will "succeed", but regardless, I do hope that it will at least serve as a stepping stone for me to achieve and learn great things in the future.

###The Scam - Dangers of entrepreneurship

Before Summer started, an older and visibly more established man approached one of my TA's, my friend, and myself for the opportunity of forming a startup with him. The older man's name was Jon.

For our first two meetings, Jon impressed the hell out of us. He was clean shaven, well spoken, insanely well dressed. When we first met, he showed up in a clean black suit and drove us in a huge S class Mercedes in order to treat us to the [nicest restaurant](http://www.montagelagunabeach.com/) in Laguna Beach. Every girl in that restaurant looked like a trophy wife and the menu's didn't even have prices on them! He had the intention of asking us to build him a prototype. Being totally impressed, we all mindlessly agreed. 

A few weeks in, several things had begun to bother me. Jon kept repeating the phrases "we are all cofounders" and "we will become billionaires". This was weird because he would only talk about the prototype and the product with us. A lot of the legal, IP, funding, company issues were simply never raised. We did not get paid and we never signed any form of paperwork for ownership, IP, equity, or salary. Whenever anything sensetive was brought up, Jon responded by exclaiming how much money we *would* make after we launch. He also treated us to weekly dinners at nice places, so we felt awkward about complaining.

Deep inside, my unease and mistrust of Jon grew. He seemed awfully closed off, he would not talk to me about his family, wife, hobbies, schedule, investments, or anything! Whenever I asked something that was slightly out of the ordinary, he would shut me up by talking about all of the wealth and prestige we would hopefully make from this "startup" and the extravagent launch party he was fixing on scheduling for us in vegas. I felt a disconnect between us, the engineers, and Jon. My [fight or flight instinct](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight-or-flight_responsehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight-or-flight_response) was screaming FLIGHT. I wanted to get out.

I asked Jon for a timeline of our operations after the prototype, **no response**. After that, I angrily decided to back out. I later found out from the TA that both the startup and prototype failed. Nothing resulted from the prototype. No big fancy launch party, no money, no shares, nothing.

*I was pretty much working with a modern day conman!* It's hard to believe, but the allure of Jon's presentation pretty much tricked the three of us to instill full trust on him with no burden of proof.

From now on, I indend on being very careful when deciding who I work with. Events like this drain motivation, waste tons of time, and are unsettling.

*After reading this, my friends and myself may come off as fools for working with Jon, but I feel that I am not characterizing him perfectly. Jon was very charismatic during our meetings. Stupid things coming out of his mouth sounded like gold at the time.*

###Internship at Canon

Interning at Canon was lots of fun. We touched upon and used a lot of services, like apache SOLR, Hadoop, Hbase, etc. I don't think I can get more specific than that though because of NDA reasons!

![Canon's Irvine campus is beautiful](/images/canon_campus.jpg)

I loved my coworkers. Sam, Quinten, Fernando, you guys are all awesome people and excellent engineers. Hari, you are a legend. I literally want to be like you when I grow up. Hari is a middle aged security engineer who drives a porshe and gives no fucks. Al prefers to stay anonymous, even on the web, so I can't say much except he has taught me a lot! Craig, you are an excellent manager! It was fun having lunch with you and working with you guys.

###Pennapps 2013 - Awesome Hacks

[Pennapps](http://pennapps.com), which is held at UPenn twice a year, is America's largest college hackathon. Attending it was very enlightening because it was my first [hackathon](https://www.google.com/search?q=define%3Ahackathon&oq=define) and I never really had the chance to sit down with a big group of other people who genuinely enjoyed building stuff. Some of the projects which were created required a **deep** understanding in multiple fields and disciplines, not just software. 

Compared to local or smaller school sponsored hackathons, this was on a whole new level. Contestants came from over **100 universities** all over the globe and free food and tons of sponsor gear were provided! I ended up recieving $100 in AWS credit, $2000 appengine credit, and 10GB Dropbox storage! Oh, and unlimited free tshirts :) 

Also, a lot of the companies which sponsored the event presented their services and [API's](http://2013f.pennapps.com/apis.html) for free usage to the contestants. This was amazing because I wasen't aware of the API's and many seemed very useful. I especially loved [firebase](https://www.firebase.com/) and [twilio](http://twilio.com/). All in all, a lot of cool stuff was built. Also, Pennsylvania and Philidelphia are both gorgeous. Check out my submission: [SocialRank](http://socialrank.codelucas.com)

If I could change something about my experience, I regret not going with a team. A lot of the teams there had shifts where one person would work while others slept or ate. This was much harder if you were alone, especially without any other friends there. 

I'm glad that hackathons exist, they bond people from different universities and countries together to not only build things together, but to mix ideas. This is powerful because the participant pool at some of the large hackathons like Pennapps, MHacks, and HackMIT is very diverse.

###Conclusion

Summer was great. My close friend from high school, Jake, came down to SoCal from Seattle to visit! I also got to visit home with my family before school started. Basketball with my brother & friends friends was fun. I'm back on campus now and ready for next year!

Tonight, I listened to the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra play, and *wow*. What an amazing concert!

They called the concert **Distant Worlds: Music from Final Fantasy.** All the music was composed by the Japanese video game composer [Nobuo Uematsu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobuo_Uematsu) and conducted by Grammy award-winner [Arnie Roth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnie_Roth).

I actually attended Distant Worlds last year too, but this was so much better than I remembered. Nobuo Uematsu was in attendance again, and as expected, the crowd gave him an extremely warm welcome.

At the end of the concert, Uematsu got a **4-minute standing ovation** (no exaggeration!) from everyone in the Final Fantasy fan-filled hall.

## Zanarkand (Final Fantasy X)

My favorite song from FF.

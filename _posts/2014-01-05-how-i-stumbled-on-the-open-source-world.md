During the [Summer of '13](http://codelucas.com/summer-of-13/) my friend Nithin and I founded a news media startup, [Wintria](http://wintria.com). We built the product, incorperated the company, hyped the brand, and then launched. For a shit ton of reasons, the product never took off.

After the demoralizing product failure at the end of Summer, Fall quarter of Junior year had started and I had been completely consumed with school and job interviews. Being in a startup during school made no sense and I opted to leave the company.

Our product itself was a search engine but it recieved its news from a seperate module which I built early in 2013. This service was conveniently dubbed [Newspaper](http://newspaper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).

After the quarter ended, I refactored the code, wrote up the documentation, and then published Newspaper open source [on Github](https://github.com/codelucas/newspaper).

I didn't think much of it at the beginning. The only benefit of publishing the code, as I thought, was that a few extra eyeballs would be on the lookout for errors and maybe a pull request or an issue alert would occur once in a while.

But what happened was much more awesome.

Quickly after publishing the code, many people had begun to download it from pypi, the python package index. On Github, my repository quickly rose to the #1 trending python spot!

To make things better, [Kenneth Reitz](https://github.com/kennethreitz/), the most followed contributor on Github and the author of the widely used [requests](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests) module tweeted and starred my repository!

At this point I was literally shaking in excitement at the idea of open source. The idea that so many people around the world can download, use, and test the code you write is both horrifying and incredible. 

It is horrifying because any bug or chunk of code that you forgot to test and clean can result in catastrophic amounts of frustration and time wasted among a huge amount of people. 

Similarly, it is incredible because of the sheer potential for positive impact. If you write a great piece of widely used software that greatly out performs its predecessors, imagine the value gained in society.

**I view the effect of public tools as a trickle down effect.** If you write bad or inefficient code that is widely used, the people using that code will have a harder time doing their jobs, which will result in the people who are relying on *those* people to get impacted as well, and so forth. The positive and negative impacts of public tools and software are huge.

Writing great and public software, in my opinion, is analogous to donating a vast and growing amount of money to charity. If Apache server never existed or was proprietary, the value lost in society would be unimaginable. In this case, even charity organizations would *literally* get affected.

I don't know what i'm going to be doing after graduation, but I hope to always be writing some form of open source software on the side.

I think setting a routine, even if it is just on a weekly basis, would be ok. Imagine if every developer in the world spent the first half of their Sunday contributing to open source software...

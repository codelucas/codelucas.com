Two years ago, I ran the fastest mile race of my life. *4 minutes and 22 seconds.*

At the beginning of my senior-year high school Track season, I set my sights on a 4:22 mile. My best time from the previous season was 4:30. I never took my eyes of the prize -- I aimed for that 4:22 all season long, slowly improving my best time every few weeks.

- Mar 8, 2008 -- 4 minutes and 31 seconds
- Mar 29, 2008 -- 4 minutes and 26 seconds
- Apr 18, 2008 -- 4 minutes and 24 seconds
- **May 16, 2008 -- 4 minutes and 22 seconds**

I finally ran a 4:22 mile at the [Sac-Joaquin Section Meet](http://archive.dyestatcal.com/?pg=dyestatcal2008Track-Road-To-State-Sections-Sac-Joaquin-Finals-Division-2#Boys 1600 Meter Run). It was the perfect way to finish up my [high school running career](http://www.athletic.net/TrackAndField/Athlete.aspx?AID=83342), and I was quite pleased with myself.

A few days later, I gave a speech at the end-of-year Track banquet where I reflected on the last 3 years of my life as a runner. There, in front of my coaches, all my teammates and their parents, I proudly proclaimed that I was a *lifelong runner* now, all thanks to my coaches who taught me to love the sport of running.

It made me happy to know that I would be a runner for the rest of my life. *What a great life!* I gave all the credit to my excellent coaches (Rob Fairley and John Mansoor) who showed me how much fun running could be.

## Fast forward to today.

I haven't run consistently for pretty much the past two years (since the first quarter of Stanford). College makes running difficult: No consistent Track or Cross Country practice to attend, no teammates to encourage you to run, and no real consequences for *not* running. Plus, there are so many other interesting things to do. Time flies.

But, something snapped in me today. I'm determined to start running again -- and to keep running. *Forever.*

## Goal: *Run daily*

So, that's the point of this blog post. I'm publicly declaring my intent to **run daily**. It doesn't matter how many miles I run each day. What's important is that I ***run daily***. I will share my progress (or lack thereof) publicly. This should raise the stakes. If I fail, everyone will see it.

Now the pressure is on -- I have to give this my best effort. <del datetime="2011-02-22T10:17:20+00:00">So, take a look at my public running log.</del> If you like what you see, share your encouragement in the comments. If you're disappointed, share that too. Everything helps.

I'm determined to reach this goal.

## Update (10/1/2010)

After running pretty consistently for a couple months, [YouTube Instant](/youtube-instant-media-frenzy/) happened to me, and I lost my consistency. :(

## Update (8/23/2012)

Yay! I've been running very consistently lately. You can follow [my running log](http://runkeeper.com/user/feross/activity/) on RunKeeper.

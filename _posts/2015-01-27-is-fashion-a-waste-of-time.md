When it comes to clothing, it's argued that people only need the bare essentials: clothes that provide warmth and block visibility of private parts; the trending clothing styles ultimately amount to a waste of time outside of aesthetic appeal.  
 
Before making such a bold claim, let's first investigate other forms of fashions to hopefully find patterns. Fashion just refers to something, or a manner of doing something, that happens to be popular at the current time. There are different types of fashions.
 
There are culinary fashions: greasy burger joints have attracted Americans for many years but health conscious joints like Chipotle and Whole Foods have been rising in popularity. There are moral fashions: it was credited to reject gay rights and interracial marriage many decades ago but doing so now would raise eyebrows. The list continues.
 
What's interesting is the process of how fashions change. A society does not go from rejecting gay rights to accepting it overnight, there is a long and drawn out process. It would require an omniscient sense to analyze how the evolution of trends happens but I have my suspicions.
 
At any given time, everyone in a society has his or her own personal opinions about a particular fashion. So we have this massive mosaic of beliefs and they are all slightly different and changing. Some people in this society promote and push their own beliefs onto others, perhaps for evangelical or financial reasons, and everyone is vulnerable to influence. Eventually, a critical mass of people will align close enough in the belief of a fashion. A domino effect is triggered; that belief is spread rapidly and soon the entire society will share that same belief due to peer and societal pressure -- and perhaps even formal education!
 
There's an important point I forgot and wanted to single out. According to the above, fashions evolve randomly. That doesn't sound right because then we as a society would not be making progress.

During WWII, the military-science high society in America had cloudy views on the moral fashion of using nuclear weapons -- implied because otherwise we would not have nuked Hiroshima and Nagasaki. After the occurrence of the devastating bombings, anti-nuke bills and laws were signed by worldwide leaders to prevent something similar to happen in the future. Society had witnessed the mutation of one of its previous beliefs, or fashions, as evil and inscribed history as such.
 
I predict that only a miniscule number of people will be smoking cigarettes within a hundred years. In the era of *Mad Men*, it was wildly in fashion to smoke but now we know better as a society because of the glaring health risks. Cigarette smoking will be ultimately logged in our history as harmful and to be avoided.
 
As time passes, the societies of the world will iterate through many various fashions. Some will have positive impact, some negative, some neutral, some novel, and some repeated. The societies will hopefully learn from their mistakes to prevent fashions that cause negative impact. I suspect this as one of the engines of progress.
 
If inspected deeper, many practical wins are discovered from reigning clothing fashions. It became fashionable in the Pacific Northwest region of America to wear North Face jackets and sandals due to the rainy weather. It became fashionable in the United Arab Emirates to dress in white colored clothing because otherwise one would burn in the heat.
 
I don't think that fashion in the context of clothing -- or anything else for that matter -- is a waste of time. Fashions are a particular set of beliefs from a large pool that have become popular. Reflecting upon the fashions of the past can give society insight for the future. This is a bold way for society to experiment and progress onward.

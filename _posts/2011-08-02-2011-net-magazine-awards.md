I'm really elated to find myself nominated for this year's [.Net Magazine Awards](http://www.thenetawards.com/).

I'm humbled by the way YouTube Instant [took off](/youtube-instant-media-frenzy/ "YouTube Instant. The last two days...") so quickly after I built it and Iâ€™m extremely thankful to the hundreds of thousands of good people who tweeted, liked, stumbled and otherwise shared my little hack and helped turn it into a [worldwide sensation](/youtube-instant-around-the-world/ "YouTube Instant Around the World") for a few weeks.

Thanks to the good people at [.Net Magazine](http://www.netmagazine.com/) for putting on this awesome award series to recognize so many of the creative people who work in web design and development. Here are the nomination categories:

- \#3 Best API Use: YouTube Instant

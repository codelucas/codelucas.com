Some of my close friends and I have tried to spread the word for my most recent project, <a href="http://darehut.com/">Darehut</a>. We initially expected it to become viral, or at least to gain a substantial user base, but unfortunately neither happened.

I have to admit, the mindset that I originally had was very naive. I assumed that the website would quickly gain a massive user-base because there was a smooth Facebook authentication system and that the website itself was modeled to spread extremely fast (after a user dares his/her friend, the combined friends of both users would be able to see the action, so exponential growth if best case). What ended up happening was pretty revealing to the mindsets of internet users.

One day post release, I was with a friend in a computer lab on campus, I showed him the website and he seemed very enthusiastic and decided to log in. But when it came time to actually post a dare, he looked a bit nervous and closed the website. This was actually one of the better cases, for many friends and random passerbys, they were even reluctant to log in! I can't pinpoint the reason exactly, but this might have to do with the recent scare over Facebook selling information, or maybe the fear of giving away personal information in general. Anyways, if these close contacts even are reluctant to log-in the website, what will randoms do? They won't even think about logging in, let alone post anything. Google Analytics shows exactly that; note the drop-off rate.

Seeing as this website took 2 months of studying frameworks and languages, along with 2-3 weeks to code, I felt pretty depressed. Even the artwork on the site was hand-drawn. I thought about dropping this website completely and just using it as a resume booster, but a Reddit private message changed my mind. Someone was actually interested in the marketing role of this site, he (I won't disclose the name without permission), said the website had good potential and it just needed solid exposure into our target demographic. <b>Long story short, i'm not giving up on darehut just yet! And now there are two people working together on the project!</b> Me and the new partner have many cool marketing strategies and techniques, and we believe that it will pay off. The engineering portion of the website will also be improved also, along with the UI.

School has been pretty busy, i'm taking about 5 classes which is 22ish units (we are on the quarter system). But these side projects are so addicting and fun, <b>my roommate Edwin showed lots of interest in the web development process, he may be working with me on future projects!</b> He's a big fan of lower level programming, like C and assembly. I'm thinking about starting another project in parallel, while working on Darehut, But that's for later. Also, the internship at M2 has been going pretty well, I got assigned to creating a component that allows for YouTube authentication and moderated video posting, ironic because i'm coding up the exact same thing for darehut!

Lastly, to the few of you who actually browse this website. I promise to make a big graphics/design overhaul on this site also, I understand that this site is really clumsy to use, but that will change soon. I'm thinking of adding a tab on the very top which shows projects that are currently being worked on. Also, before this blog ends, I want anyone who is interested in the <a href="http://lukepop.com/Apps/IslandOverlord.html">"IslandOverlord"</a> project to know that it will be finished and ported to android in due time! At the moment i'm totally overloaded but I promise that the game will be finished.

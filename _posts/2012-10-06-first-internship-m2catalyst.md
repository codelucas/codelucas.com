A good friend from UCI  recently referred me to a mobile  position at a startup that is located pretty close to campus. The company, [`M2Catalyst`](http://www.m2catalyst.com/), was started fairly recently. This is a part time job and not a Summer internship.

This will be my first ever development job. The interview process was smooth and the engineers liked my java applet games and web apps so I think I had it easy! Considering that sophomore year just started, I feel pretty lucky to have a part time job! Finally some money to pay for those server costs ;)

M2 is an `android startup` and it's campus is <u>only 20 minutes</u> away from my university, so it's rather convenient. I don't actually know any android, so i'm jumping in with an open mind!

**It's been far too long.** I haven't updated my blog since September 24th when [YouTube Instant](http://ytinstant.com) hit [one million visitors in 10 days](/one-million-visitors-in-10-days/). So much has happened since then.

**I'm writing this blog post to break the silence.** Yes, I'm still here. Still alive and doing well. Doing excellently, actually. I'm working on some exciting stuff and can't wait to share it with you all over the next few weeks.

**Stay tuned.**

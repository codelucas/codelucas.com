A good friend from school referred me for a mobile position at a startup fairly close to our campus. The company, [M2Catalyst](http://www.m2catalyst.com/), was founded only a few months ago! 

I'm excited because this will be my first ever development job, as opposed to just building random projects by myself. M2 is mostly an Android shop. I don't actually know any Android but I really plan on learning!

M2 had a smooth interview process and the other engineers there really liked my Java Applet games. Looking forward to the next few months. Cheers!

I recently heard from a friend back home in Washington that Margarette Wittmier (*Marge for short*), our neighborhood "Candy Lady", had passed away at the age of 77. From when my family moved to Washington, we lived in a small neighborhood in the woods called Klahanie. Every day after school, long and orderly lines of late elementary to early high-schoolers would form outside of Marge's house; filled with children eager to receive their daily baggies of free candy along with Marge's compliments, neighborhood gossip, advice, and good wishes.

After over 15 years of growing up in the rainy Seattle suburb, my clearest and most wistful memory is of the day when I met Marge with some older friends from middle school after my first day of 5th grade. Aside from the free candy and soda - *which was fantastic! my parents were strict about junk food* - I was surprised at how kind and understanding Marge, a total stranger, was towards me. She would give me advice on how to deal with bullies and make friends, reminders to always wear a helmet while biking, stuff like that. And she was this personable and caring to all the kids in our community, not just me! She was a big part of my life and I cried when I heard of her passing.

Marge ended up passing away peacefully in 2009 and her funeral had an enormous showing. A lot of the kids who went to her house many years ago, and had grown up, were present. There were also a lot of younger children present, crying with their parents. Marge's children and great grand-children were nobly championing donations to the American Cancer Society and a memorial bench in Marge's name. The donation amounts (*from what I've heard*) were tremendous.

Being a busy and stressed out high schooler, I couldn't connect the dots at the time; but the closure is clear. Being kind matters. A lot. I hit the eureka! moment after reading this Quora Q/A answer from Charlie Cheever (*an engineer & entrepreneur from Silicon Valley that I look up too*):

> It's not one big thing but a bunch of little things that add up ... if you treat people well your whole life, you'll find yourself with a whole bunch of friends later on in life and it will be a lot easier for you to be successful, whereas if you rip people off or are just unkind, it won't matter much in the short term but years later, its likely to add up to being lonely and without allies. 

If you want the full context for both the question and Charlie's answer, feel free to [read it here](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-lessons-learned-through-playing-StarCraft-that-are-useful-in-real-life/answer/Charlie-Cheever).

As of now, I've never made a conscious choice towards being unconditionally kind. Not because I'm being evil or malicious, but it didn't seem worth it for me personally to go out of my way to help others, even when it's easy for me to do something to greatly help someone else. This changes now, and I encourage **you**, the reader to also rethink how you treat others in your life. Being kind isn't just worth it because it's helpful and pleasant for the world, but it may counter-intuitively be **in your best interest**.

I also want to add that it's not enough to be occasionally kind or kind only in the public eye. Reputation matters and people can sniff out narcissism / egotism. It's not like Marge posted fliers about how much free candy she gave kids (that would have obviously come off wrong); she merely behaved the way she did and her reputation quickly spread.

We all have examples of how we can help others in our lives: teachers in high-school can go out of their way to write long and considerate letters to get their students into the best schools. For me personally, being further along in my career, I get a lot of resumes from college or grad school kids looking for jobs at various tech firms. Taking 5 minutes out of my life to forward a resume can be literally life-changing to an eager student.

I recently heard from a friend back home in Washington that Margarette Wittmier (*Marge for short*), our neighborhood "Candy Lady", had passed away at the age of 77. From when my family moved to Washington, we lived in a small and close-knit neighborhood in the woods called Klahanie. Every day after school, long and orderly lines of late elementary to early high-schoolers would form outside of Marge's house; filled with children eager to receive their daily baggies of free candy along with Marge's compliments, neighborhood gossip, advice, and good wishes.

After over 15 years of growing up in the rainy Seattle suburb, my clearest and most wistful memory is of the day when I met Marge with some older friends from middle school after my first day of 5th grade. Aside from the free candy and soda - *which was fantastic! my parents were strict about junk food* - Marge was very kind and understanding towards me. She would give me advice on how to deal with bullies and make friends, reminders to always wear a helmet while biking, stuff like that. And she was this personable and caring to all the kids in our community, not just me.

This was all just something she did to pass her time, she loved kids: seeing them, helping them, interacting with them. Every Halloween night, her house was a complete spectacle; there were cars lined up over ten blocks down, each filled with kids from other counties, eager to meet the mythical woman. She was a big part of my life and I cried when I heard of her passing.

Marge ended up [passing away peacefully](http://www.memorialobituaries.com/memorials/obits_display.cgi?action=Obit&memid=197839) in 2009 and her funeral had an enormous showing. A lot of the kids who went to her house many years ago, and had grown up, were present. There were also a lot of younger children present, crying with their parents. Marge's children and great grand-children were championing donations to the American Cancer Society and a memorial bench in Marge's name. The donation amounts, *from what I've heard*, were tremendous.

Being kind matters. A lot. Being kind isn't just pleasant to others, but it has a gradual self-reinforcing power. See [this Quora Q/A answer](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-lessons-learned-through-playing-StarCraft-that-are-useful-in-real-life/answer/Charlie-Cheever) from Charlie Cheever, *an engineer & entrepreneur from Silicon Valley that I look up too*:

> It's not one big thing but a bunch of little things that add up ... if you treat people well your whole life, you'll find yourself with a whole bunch of friends later on in life and it will be a lot easier for you to be successful, whereas if you rip people off or are just unkind, it won't matter much in the short term but years later, its likely to add up to being lonely and without allies. 

"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you" isn't a novel concept but I think the idea of scaling it, continually doing what's right and creating a snowball effect of allies and goodwill, is pretty cool and inspiring. **Perhaps this is now karma actually works - and we've been interpreting it all wrong**. Karma doesn't take place from one-off incidents: cheat on your wife and get hit by a car? Nah, what are the odds. But how about twenty years of being an asshole to your family, coworkers, and peers? I'd bet on some of that negative karma!

I've never made a conscious choice towards being perpetually kind to everyone. Not out of maliciousness, but laziness. This changes now, and I encourage you, the reader to also rethink the habit of how you treat others in your life. Being kind isn't just worth it because it's helpful and pleasant for the world, but it may counter-intuitively be **in your best interest**.

We all have examples of how we can help others in our lives: teachers in high-school can go out of their way to write long and considerate letters to get their students into the best schools. For me personally, being further along in my career, I get a lot of resumes from college or grad school kids looking for jobs at various tech firms. Taking five minutes out of my life to forward a resume can be literally life-changing to an eager student.

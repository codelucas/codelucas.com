Hey everyone. I'm working on a couple of cool new projects that I want to let you know about!

## AP Study Notes

I'm planning to completely rehaul my [AP notes site](http://www.apstudynotes.org/), APstudynotes.org, and ***rebuild it from the ground up***. Right now, it has a bunch of awesome notes for 3 popular AP classes ([US history](http://www.apstudynotes.org/us-history/ "AP US history notes"), [US government](http://www.apstudynotes.org/us-government/ "AP US government notes"), and [English Language/Literature](http://www.apstudynotes.org/english/ "AP english notes")), but it's still lacking in quite a few areas.

The site is still in development, and I've got a lot of work to do on it, but it's already been extraordinarily popular. Right now, it's getting 1,200,000 page views and 520,000 unique visitors annually! I haven't advertised it at all, but the feedback has been overwhelming. I get emails every week from thankful students, and even some from eager students asking why the notes for a particular AP class aren't posted yet!

My *goal* was to keep adding new notes (my own or purchased/donated notes from other students), and over time, slowly build up a **huge database** of quality notes. At some point in this process, I realized that this method simply ***doesn't scale very well***. There are simply *too many classes, too many textbooks, and too many types of notes* (outlines, vocabulary, unit summaries, practice quizzes, etc.) for me to create and format all by myself. So, I stopped updating the site for a while.

My goal in re-hauling the site is to allow users to ***add their own notes to the site***, and let the community decide what the good stuff is. My hope is that **the good stuff will float to the top**.

I have a a bunch of really neat ideas (I think!) that will make this*** the best AP notes site on the net***. I don't want to divulge too much here, but I believe that when it's finished, it will be an invaluable resource to high school students taking AP classes.

## Music site

My second project is still in the planning phase. But, for now, just imagine one website that will ***satisfy ALL of your musical needs***: MP3 downloads, online streaming, concert tickets, music videos, album art, lyrics, music suggestions, and social features. I have a vision for ***an awesome online music experience***, and I can't wait to start working on this one.

I know that there are plenty of great music sites out there right now, like Lala.com, Last.fm, iMeem.com, iLike.com, Pandora, and others, but I believe that I can build something unique that brings plenty of new ideas to the table. Plus, I think this will be ***a great way to practice a whole slew of important web dev skills***: Javascript, web crawling, data mining, large-scale database management, and more. **I can't wait to see where this idea goes!**

### Update

I finished the music project, though it turned out quite different than I originally planned! [Instant.fm](http://instant.fm)

## Blog might not be updated for a while...

I'll try to keep you guys updated as I work on these projects. If you don't hear from me for a while, it's because I'm coding like a madman!

If you have any ideas or suggestions for me, please let me know in the comments! **Thanks a ton for your support!**

Last weekend, my buddy [Jason](http://jasontanner.me/) angrily told me that he'd stop being my friend if I continued to support Chris Brown, a well known American musician that got into legal trouble after physically abusing his girlfriend. We got into an argument about whether an artist's personal life should affect our perception of his or her work.

At first, I aggressively claimed that the greatness of an artist's work should be judged on its own merits, how could his or her personal life possibly have any effect?

The story of Michael Jackson makes for a great example; Michael was arguably one of the most successful musicians in American history despite having a tragic, and very widely publicized, personal life. He allegedly committed sickening acts such as sexually abusing children. At the same time, he accomplished phenomenal work like producing Thriller, the best selling album of all time.

Why should the fans of Thriller care about, or even have an awareness of, the terrible things that Michael did behind the scenes? To the fans, Thriller may as well be from an anonymous author. Each fan gets something different out of the album, may it be the: rhythm, lyrics, message, etc.

Jason made a counter argument that if an artist was any good, the personality of the author and events from his or her personal life would creep into the artist's work. It was a good point, how could Chris Brown sing about loving a girl when he physically abused his own girlfriend, Rihanna? Sure, Chris Brown's fans are listening for whatever aspect of his music that they love, but the music itself has been a fraud.

Artists convey their emotions through their work. A lot of why we like a particular song has to do with our emotional connection with the song and its artist. In this example, Chris Brown's music is not authentic at the very core and his fans have every right to be furious after [what happened to Rihanna](http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2009/images/03/05/brown.warrant.pdf) was publicized.

The concept discussed above can be generalized to everyday people and actions. The friendly classmate helping you with your job hunt? Oh, he's just doing that because he's secretly an egomaniac. Many of the pretty girls who volunteer and try to live a good life also reject ugly or poor guys viciously and without care.

The impact that an artist's personal life has on the public perception of his or her work should be decided on a case by case basis depending on the artist, work, and genre of art.

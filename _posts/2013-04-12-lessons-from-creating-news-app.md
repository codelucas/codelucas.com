This article is intended to motivate you lazy programmers &amp; entrepreneurs out there to get out and create. I'll use one of my own creations, Wintria, as an example. I've been working on Wintria, a web app &amp; site for a while now since it's `demo release in Nov.'12` to friends and Reddit.

In essence, <a href="http://wintria.com">Wintria</a> is a website which pulls popular news articles and links from all over the internet and displays them elegantly in front of users, see it for yourself <a href="http://wintria.com">here</a>.

From programming this website, i've learned a TON! I recommend thatÂ all of you create at least `one side project`.

<u>**Here is what i've learned from creating just one:**</u>

- **Language** - Deeper understanding of Python, Javascript, CSS
- **Libraries** - Exposure to libraries and frameworks, usage of django, lxml, [NLTK](http://nltk.org)
- **Multi Facet** - Exposure to the front end, or back end depending on your normal programming environment
- **Analytics &amp; Testing** - Using the power of analytics tools and testing, Betapunch, Google analytics, etc
- **Scripting &amp; Resources** - Understanding the pain of being a Sysadmin, ... i'm so bad at it.. :(
- **Optimization** - Understanding of caching, static files, and task queues for speed.
- **Personality** - Becoming a more hardworking &amp; humble person when realizing ur app is still not up to par and still sucks relative to others

<u>**Here are some unexpected &amp; pleasant side effects from cool side projects:**</u>

- Interest from big companies for opportunities: adobe, canon, facebook, google, samsung - **pretty much everyone**
- Impress friends &amp; girls - **or guys if ur a girl coder :)**
- Impress universities - **looking @ u HS freshman-sophomores** w/ nothing to do :)
- Potential side income?
- Potential chance to become the next Tony Stark &amp; Mark Zuckerburg? We can all dream right?
- Self motivation &amp; realization, these things can suck the laziness and boredom out of anyone

For different projects, the lessons learned will be different, so branch out and create many great things. **You are programmers, you have a magic power compared to everyone else, take advantage of it!**

There will always be an excuse to not go out and do some not required extra curricular thing like this. Too many classes, work, friends &amp; social life, the list literally goes on and on. Stop being a noob and start making something for the sake of humanity.

Well that's the end of the motivation part of the article for now, **if you'd like to know more about Wintria and our team, continue reading below**!

My friends and I feel confident for this project or perhaps even startup in the near future. I originally coded the demo in **18 hours**. We released it to see how well it would perform. The feedback was strong! The site remained #1 on r/startups for an entire day, and we got `350+ tweets`. All the site did in the demo was grab articles from four websites and auto refresh the homepage in real time with ajax.

Since the demo, roughly 3 months?, the core of the website has remained the same but we have created a much stronger news extraction engine. It's built on top of lxml and it now implements multithreading.

When June came along, I met [Nithin Jilla](http://nithinjilla.com), an Entrepreneur & fellow CS grad and what started off as a small project became a real company! Nithin helped with the incorporation + many of the business and legal aspects of a startup I would have otherwise never thought of. Nithin taught me to think **big**. Wintria is now **investor backed**!

Anyways, our new extraction engine will be implemented on production soon, and i'll keep you guys updated on the next beta release. Also, I haven't made a personal blog post in a while now, I think the net one will be just that.

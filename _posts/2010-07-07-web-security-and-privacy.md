[This](/images/Web-Security-and-Privacy.pdf) is a research paper I wrote about **Web Security and Privacy**. It's quite an interesting read, if you've got 20 minutes to spare.

I wrote the entire final draft of this 25-page paper in less than 24 hours. Coding up the proof-of-concept attack page demo took two days, and gathering information took several weeks, but I finished the actual writing in less than one full day.

This blog was heavily inspired by [Ferros's Blog](http://feross.org).

## How it's built

All my posts are written in Markdown. The blog is powered by [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), a static site generator that takes Markdown blog posts and converts them into HTML files. The benefit of this approach are many:

- The blog can be served with almost any web server, since the output of Jekyll is just flat HTML files.
- The whole blog can easily be version controlled.
- The blog requires less maintainance (goodbye out-of-date Wordpress installations!)

# [codelucas.com](http://codelucas.com) Blog

This blog was heavily inspired by [Ferros's Blog](http://feross.org). I will add more specifics later.

## How it's built

All my posts are written in Markdown. The blog is powered by [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), a static site generator that takes Markdown blog posts and converts them into HTML files.

      <h1>Hi, it's nice to meet you!</h1>
      <p class="lead">
         My full name is Lucas Lee Ou-Yang. 
         I am 20 years old and I was born in Dallas, Texas in 1993. 
      </p>

        <p><em>My parents decided to name me after 
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_IV:_A_New_Hope">Luke Skywalker</a>, 
        as they were Star Wars fans!</em> </p>

        <p>
        I've lived in Dallas, Chicago, Austin, Seattle, and Orange County.
        I run, snowboard, code, and read in my spare time.  </p>

        <p>In the Fall of '11, I started university at <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/">UCI</a> in California, 
        where I learned how to write code. Learning how to program has changed my life. </p>
        
        <p>In the Winter of '12, I wrote my first game, <a href="http://codelucas.com/pages/rocketboy.html">
            RocketBoy!</a>, a 2-D platformer.</p>

        <p>In the Summer of '12, I wrote a much more complicated game where I hand drew all the
        graphics, <a href="http://codelucas.com/pages/island-overlord.html">IslandOverlord</a>, 
        inspired by one of <a href="https://mojang.com/notch/">Notch's</a> early games.</p>

        <p>In the Fall of '12 I wrote <a href="https://github.com/codelucas/darehut.com">Darehut</a>, a website 
        where teenagers can dare eachother to do things. Darehut was built with 
        A lot of <a href="http://reddit.com">Reddit's</a> internal code and mechanics.</p>
        
        <p>In the Winter of '12, I interned at <a href="http://www.m2catalyst.com/">M2Catalyst</a>, where I 
        learned how to build android modules.</p>

        <p>In the Summer of '13, I started a news entertainment company, <a href="http://wintria.com">Wintria</a> 
        with my friend <a href="http://www.nithinjilla.com/">Nithin Jilla</a>. We hit 4K unique visitors on 
        our first day of release and became investor backed. I wrote all of the backend and frontend 
        code for Wintria.</p>

        <p>In the Fall of '13 I attended <a href="http://pennapps.com">Pennapps</a>, the biggest college 
        hackathon in America and built <a href="http://socialrank.codelucas.com">SocialRank</a>. 
        SocialRank is a news aggregator using 
        <a href="http://amix.dk/blog/post/19588">Reddit's hotness algorithm</a> but using Facebook 
        likes instead of upvotes!</p>

        <p>Currently, I am working on <a href="http://newspaper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">Newspaper</a> 
        and <a href="http://antchatter.com">Antchatter</a>. 
        Newspaper is a python library which abstracts online news extraction and curation.
        Antchatter is a chatroom for university students... but with a twist!</p>

        <p>I will be interning at <a href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</a> in the Summer of '14.</p>

        <p>I hope to graduate in the Fall of '14 with a degree in Computer Science. I have no 
        intentions for grad school. I want to write open source code and work for an impactful 
        company or group of people.</p>

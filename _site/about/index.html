      <h2>Hello! My name is Lucas!</h2>

<div class="left">
    <p>Hello, my full name is Lucas Lee Ou-Yang. I am 20 years old and I was born in
    Dallas, Texas in 1993.</p>

    <p><em>My parents decided to name me after 
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_IV:_A_New_Hope">Luke Skywalker</a>, 
    as they were Star Wars fans!</em> </p>

    <p>
    I've lived in Dallas, Chicago, Austin, Seattle, and Orange County.
    I run, snowboard, code, and read in my spare time.  </p>

    <p>In the Fall of '11, I started university at <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/">UCI</a> in California, 
    where I learned how to write code. Learning how to program has changed my life. </p>
    
    <p>In the Winter of '12, I wrote my first game, <a href="http://codelucas.com/pages/rocketboy.html">
        RocketBoy!</a>, a 2-D platformer.</p>

    <p>In the Summer of '12, I wrote a much more complicated game where I hand drew all the
    graphics, <a href="http://codelucas.com/pages/island-overlord.html">IslandOverlord</a>, 
    inspired by one of <a href="https://mojang.com/notch/">Notch's</a> early games.</p>

    <p>In the Fall of '12 I wrote <a href="https://github.com/codelucas/darehut">Darehut</a>, a website 
    where teenagers can dare eachother to do things. Darehut was built with 
    A lot of <a href="http://reddit.com">Reddit's</a> internal code and mechanics.</p>
    
    <p>In the Winter of '12, I interned at <a href="http://www.m2catalyst.com/">M2Catalyst</a>, where I 
    learned how to build android modules.</p>

    <p>In the Summer of '13, I started a news entertainment company, <a href="http://wintria.com">Wintria</a> 
    with my friend <a href="http://www.nithinjilla.com/">Nithin Jilla</a>. We hit 4K unique visitors on 
    our first day of release and became investor backed. I wrote all of the backend and frontend 
    code for Wintria.</p>

    <p>In the Fall of '13 I attended <a href="http://pennapps.com">Pennapps</a>, the biggest college 
    hackathon in America and built <a href="http://socialrank.codelucas.com">SocialRank</a>. 
    SocialRank is a news aggregator using 
    <a href="http://amix.dk/blog/post/19588">Reddit's hotness algorithm</a> but using Facebook 
    likes instead of upvotes!</p>

    <p>Currently, I am working on <a href="http://newspaper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">Newspaper</a> 
    and <a href="http://antchatter.com">Antchatter</a>. 
    Newspaper is a python library which abstracts online news extraction and curation.
    Antchatter is a chatroom for university students... but with a twist!</p>

    <p>I will be interning at <a href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</a> in the Summer of '14.</p>

    <p>I hope to graduate in the Fall of '14 with a degree in Computer Science. I have no 
    intentions for grad school. I want to write open source code and work for an impactful 
    company or group of people.</p>

    <!--
    My parents immigrated to the U.S. in year 1990 from China. 
    They enjoy reminding me about how difficult life was for them. I remember
    watching my dad relentlessly practice english by mimicking the voice of a 
    news anchor in front of our 15" TV. Now, my parents speak great english 
    now and it sounds natural. I think of events like this when something I want 
    seems impossible or unnatural. I was told that anyone can have anything 
    that they want as long as they take action.

    Our family traveled a lot. We moved out of Texas; 
    my brother, Jack, was born on 1996 in Chicago. We also spent some time living in
    various cities in China before finally settling in Seattle, Washington, where
    my parents both found a job which they enjoyed.

    <!--
    Before learning how to program, I spent my middle and highschool years in Washington. We lived in a beautiful
    place nicknamed the "The Plateau" by locals. The Plateau consisted of several
    suburbs surrounded by huge forests on top of a plateau (of course). 
    I loved everything about our home and neighborhood, there were trees, 
    wild deer, and squirrels everywhere. When we were younger, My friends and I would 
    build teepees, huts, docks, sleds, you name it. The people were as friendly as can be. 
    -->

    <!--
    There was an old lady, named Marge, in our neighborhood who would 
    buy huge bags of candy and snacks from Costco and hand them out to children 
    just as a friendly gesture. We all called her the Candy Lady.
    She passed away a few years ago and all of the neighborhood children (grown up)
    cried at her funeral.
    -->

    <!--
    I enjoyed my middle and highschool years. I was shy but I had friends and I was 
    happy. My highschool, Skyline High, was known for its football team. We won the state
    championship 7 (?) times! I am not into football but I was glad to be a part of 
    something big like that. 
    -->

    <!--
    After highschool, I decided to make something of myself, like everyone else, by
    going to college. I attended UCI, in southern California, under a computer 
    science major. After my very first intro to CS class I felt that I discovered exactly
    what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.

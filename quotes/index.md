> January 1st is my favorite day of the year. Quiet, reflective, and full of potential. If only we could make this our every day.

> -- Jack Dorsey

<!-- -->
> Most inventors and engineers I've met are like me ... they live in their heads. They're almost like artists. In fact, the very best of them are artists. And artists work best alone ... I'm going to give you some advice that might be hard to take. That advice is: Work alone ... Not on a committee. Not on a team.

> -- Steve Wozniak

<!-- -->
> Interviewer: "You could have simply worn a fat suit to give the character his chunky feeling. Why did you decide to go whole hog (so to speak) and actually gain the weight?"

> Jared Leto: "I really wanted to inhabit this guy's skin, and that affected the way I stood, walked and moved. I wanted to make it clear that this was someone who felt very isolated from people, who shyed away from human contact. Also, being overweight, I felt the rejection and mockery of people who didn't know that I was just playing a part. Their response to me as an overweight and unattractive guy just made me realize how isolated he felt, how unloved and how untouched by human beings.
> I kind of turned into a sculpture."

> -- Jared Leto, on gaining 70 pounds vs. wearing a fat suit for the leading role of "Chapter 27"

<!-- -->
> The Gods envy us. They envy us because we're mortal, because any moment might be our last. Everything is more beautiful because we're doomed. You will never be lovelier than you are now. We will never be here again.

> -- Achilles to Briseis, Troy

> What's so great about Lisp? And if Lisp is so great, why doesn't everyone use it? Lisp is so great not because of some magic quality visible only to devotees, but because it is simply the most powerful language available. And the reason everyone doesn't use it is that programming languages are not merely technologies, but habits of mind as well, and nothing changes slower...

> I'll begin with a shockingly controversial statement: programming languages vary in power.

> Few would dispute, at least, that high level languages are more powerful than machine language. Most programmers today would agree that you do not, ordinarily, want to program in machine language. Instead, you should program in a high-level language, and have a compiler translate it into machine language for you.

> Everyone knows it's a mistake to write your whole program by hand in machine language. What's less often understood is that there is a more general principle here: that if you have a choice of several languages, it is, all other things being equal, a mistake to program in anything but the most powerful one.

> -- [The Blub Paradox](http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html), Paul Graham

<!-- -->
> Over at reddit.com, we rewrote the site from Lisp to Python in the past week. It was pretty much done in one weekend. The others knew Lisp...and they knew Python...and yet they decided liked Python better for this project. The Python version had less code that ran faster and was far easier to read and maintain.

> The idea that there is something better than Lisp is apparently inconceivable to some, judging from comments on the reddit blog. The Lispers instead quickly set about trying to find the real reason behind the switch.

> One assumed it must have been divine intervention, since "there seems to be no other reason for switching to an inferior language." Another figured something else must be going on: "Could this be...a lie? To throw off competition? It's not as though Paul Graham hasn't hinted at this tactic in his essays..."

> A male mouse and a female mouse will soon tire of mating with each other. But put new partners into the cage, and it turns out they weren't tired at all. They were just bored.

> -- Ezra Klein

<!-- -->
> The world is full of low IQ people that try to look intelligent and fall on their ass, and Steve, I think is a fairly high IQ person that does a great job at looking stupid, and that's probably why he's succesful at what he does.

> -- Steve-O's Dad

<!-- -->
> We understand walls in terms of bricks, bricks in terms of crystals, crystals in terms of molecules, and etc.

> -- Dijkstra, Turing Speech 1947

<!-- -->
> The purpose of abstracting is not to be vague, but it is to create a new semantic level where one can be absolutely precise.

> -- Dijkstra, Turing Speech 1947

<!-- -->
> I discovered that I could be a better programmer by using only the good parts and avoiding the bad parts. After all, how can you build something good out of bad parts?

<!-- -->
> Never underestimate the importance of making money from making music. Let go of any weird taboos you have about it. Money is nothing more than neutral proof that you're adding value to people's lives. Making sure you're making money is just a way of making sure you're doing something of value to others.

> -- Derek Sivers, "6 things to know before Berklee Music School"

<!-- -->
> I highly believe that financial reward is a strong indicator of the impact that you're having on the world.

> -- Dustin Moskovitz

<!-- -->
> Be curious. Read widely. Try new things. I think a lot of what people call intelligence just boils down to curiosity.

> -- Aaron Swartz, "Guy who hacked MIT's library", Reddit Cofounder, RSS Architect

<!-- -->
> My opinion, then and now, is that C and other languages without memory checks are unsuitable for writing secure code. Plainly unsuitable. They need to be restricted to writing a small core system, preferably small enough that it can be checked using formal (proof-based) methods, and all the rest, including all application logic, should be written using managed code (such as C#, Java) ...

> The fact is that no programmer is good enough to write code which is free from such vulnerabilities ... in languages without bounds checks ... All non-bounds-checked languages expose multiple levels of the computer to the program, and you are kidding yourself if you think you can handle this better than the OpenSSL team.

> -- HackerNews on The HeartBleed OpenSSL Bug.

<!-- -->
> You've got potential, kid, more potential than any wizard I've ever seen, but you've got to learn how to use it, you know? Be a bit sweeter to them, learn some spells to clean up that mess you call hair. Above all, you need to hide your evilness better - not too well, but better.

> Nice well-groomed boys get girls, and Dark Wizards also get girls, but nice well-groomed boys suspected of being secretly Dark get more girls than you can imagine.

> When engineers working on the very first iPod completed the prototype, they presented their work to Steve Jobs for his approval. Jobs played with the device, scrutinized it, weighed it in his hands, and promptly rejected it. It was too big.

> The engineers explained that they had to reinvent inventing to create the iPod, and that it was simply impossible to make it any smaller. Jobs was quiet for a moment. Finally he stood, walked over to an aquarium, and dropped the iPod in the tank. After it touched bottom, bubbles floated to the top.

> "Those are air bubbles," he snapped. "That means there's space in there. Make it smaller."

> I made a bug once, and I need to tell you about it. So, in 2001, I wrote a reference library for JSON, in Java, and in it, I had this line

> `private int index`

> that created a variable called "index" which counted the number of characters in the JSON text that we were parsing, and it was used to produce an error message. Last year, I got a bug report from somebody. It turns out that they had a JSON text which was several gigabytes in size, and they had a syntax error past two gigabytes, and my JSON library did not properly report where the error was - it was off by two gigabytes, which, that's kind of a big error, isn't it?  And the reason was, I used an int.
    
> Now, I can justify my choice in doing that.  At the time that I did it, two gigabytes was a really big disk drive, and my use of JSON still is very small messages.  My JSON messages are rarely bigger than a couple of K.  And - a couple gigs, yeah that's about a thousand times bigger than I need, I should be all right.  No, turns out it wasn't enough.
    
> You might think well, one bug in 12 years you're doing pretty good.  And I'm saying no, that's not good enough.  I want my programs to be perfect.  I don't want anything to go wrong.  And in this case it went wrong simply because *Java gave me a choice that I didn't need, and I made the wrong choice*.

> But being great isn't as easy as just picking a hard goal - in fact, picking a really hard goal avoids reality almost as much as picking a really easy one. If you pick an easy goal, you know you'll always succeed; if you pick a really hard one, you know you'll never fail (because it will always be too early to tell). Artificial intelligence is a truly big problem - how can you possibly expect us to succeed in just a decade? But we're making great progress, we swear.

> If your startup is eventually going to make a million dollars, can it start by making ten? If your book is going to eventually persuade the world, can you start by persuading your friends?
